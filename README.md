### Code Review

  I made three components, Header, Footer and Navigation in Header component. Actually, I have done this for both assignments, 3 and 4. however, I will improve a little more for the assignment 4. Wow anyway, it took my time pretty a lot.

  This is continued from the outcome of assignment 1 and I have done the requirements in this assignment.
  And I dug a little deeper with some experiments and found that, in a metaphor, this netlifycms is a wheel when Wordpress is a rocket. 
  However, I think that could be a right one for developers who are looking for a wheel or wheels-like-cms with particular potentials.
